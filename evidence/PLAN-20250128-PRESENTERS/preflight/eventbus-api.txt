EventBus API Verification
=========================

Command: grep -n "pub fn" src/events/bus.rs
Output:
31:    pub fn new(capacity: usize) -> Self {
44:    pub fn publish(&self, event: AppEvent) -> Result<usize, EventBusError> {
55:    pub fn subscribe(&self) -> broadcast::Receiver<AppEvent> {
63:    pub fn subscriber_count(&self) -> usize {

Command: grep -n "broadcast::Receiver" src/events/bus.rs
Output:
55:    pub fn subscribe(&self) -> broadcast::Receiver<AppEvent> {

Result: PASS - EventBus has subscribe() returning broadcast::Receiver<AppEvent>
